# Simple-Batch-File-Renamer
Two simple windows cmd scripts that will batch rename files to a specified name.

renameImport will rename files that contain a key word. renameOutput will rename files that contain a key word but it will also replace the first 4 characters and attach them to the end.

E.g 1234_UNWANTEDNAME.txt will be renamed to NEWNAME_1234.csv


This script was created because I have to download files with set names and rename the files to something else as part of my Data Migrations work.
So I decided to automate it with this simple batch script because I HATE manually renaming files!!
